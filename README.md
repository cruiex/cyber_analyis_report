# 🛡️ Cyber Detection and Deception

> **Lead Author & Analyst**: [ROHIT]

## 🧠 Overview

**Cyber Detection and Deception** is a behavioral analysis project focused on visualizing patterns of malicious cyber activity using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The work emphasizes detection and awareness of threats like ransomware, phishing, botnets, fraud, and social engineering through intuitive data visualizations and system-level indicators.

The project includes a detailed academic report prepared by the team, highlighting our methods, findings, and visual insights. All analysis and modeling were performed using **Google Colab**.

## 📄 Final Report

- A structured analysis of cyber threats based on CPU/disk/network behavior
- Phishing detection using URL features and user interaction metrics
- A real-world Instagram dataset collected over two months to study social engineering
- Visualizations and model-based interpretations designed for clarity and impact
